## Student Profile
I am a quick thinker and can explain complex scenarios in easy to understand ways. Determined to excel in software design and implementation roles demanding immense analytical and organizational insight.
Well versed in Java, Rust and C#. I am very familiar with version control, CI and CD processes and have worked with complex APIs such as Discord and OpenWeather.
I work well as part of a collaborative community and independantly. I am extremely detail oriented and analytical in design.

## Development Work
All of it is linked in my GitHub profile as it is my primary development platform.
I also host and manage an extensive home server including nested virtualisation and containerised applications.
I am current designing and building a mechanically complex game in the Unity Engine.
I have experience in System Simulations where I designed and implemented a Completely fair Scheduler using a binomial heap instead of a self-balancing binary tree.
